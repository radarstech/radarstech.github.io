Get to know the cyclist behind the techie of Stark, as he pedals towards a healthy life.<\/h5>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"\/>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1) When did you start cycling and when did you take it up seriously?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I started cycling quite early. At the age of 12, to be precise.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since then there has been no looking back. In March 2019, I joined the Cycling Club and this leap helped me improve my cycling skills and took my fitness to new heights. Since then, I have developed better camaraderie, boosted my bike handling, met like-minded people and found new mentors.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2) What is the biggest challenge you\u2019ve faced in cycling?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That would be the 600 kilometres road bicycle race. It was pouring the entire time of the race and I completed it in 39 hours. For me, that has been the most challenging race.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3) What is one memorable moment or milestone you\u2019ve covered? <\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As I mentioned, the 600 kilometres I covered in 39 hours is so far the most memorable milestone.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>4) How often do you go out on your bike? <\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Weekly 4 to 5 days<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>5) How do you prepare yourself for a cyclothon? <\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Come rain or shine, I cycle for 30 to 50 kilometres daily.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>6) How would you advise someone who hasn\u2019t exercised for a long time, and just wants to get fit?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Someone who wants to get fit must have a strong passion towards it and make up their mind to work out, no matter what comes their way. He\/she must possess a determined mind, one which helps them overcome the constant pressure to give up. By making it a part of their daily routine, it becomes quite easy to work towards their fitness goals.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>7) Which is your favourite training destination? <\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That would be Ponmudi.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>8) What other sports or cross training do you do to stay fit? <\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Badminton, Cricket, Football, Walking, Hiking.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>9) What is one milestone you aim to achieve in the near future? <\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Velo\u2019 a Ooty<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>10) What&#8217;s your advice for someone getting into cycling for the first time?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That would be a long list.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first step to make riding a habit is to be realistic.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Get a reasonable bike for the type of riding you\u2019re going to be doing, like mountain bike, road bike, etc.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Get it fitted properly so it\u2019s an appropriate size for you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Get some cycling shorts, ideally bib shorts<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Buy and wear a decent helmet.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Be careful when riding on the road. Familiarise yourself with the road traffic law, highway code, etc. and follow them. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Don\u2019t run red lights. Respect other road users and pedestrians. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Join a club. Or find friends who ride. It\u2019s more fun and safer to ride with a group. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Learn some basic maintenance skills like fixing a puncture. eg how to fix a puncture. Carry a few basic tools, a pump and spares to get you out of trouble.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>For Santhosh, the biking enthusiast, no mountain\u2019s too high and no road is too long.
