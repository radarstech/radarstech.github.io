It takes me a few seconds to understand her question.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Red zone or orange?&#8221; she continues. &#8220;Oh, orange,&#8221; I tell her.<br>&#8220;Same here. How many cases?&#8221; &#8220;14 new as of yesterday evening.&#8221; &#8220;Oh! That&#8217;s bad.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Where\u2019s my mask?&#8221; my husband interrupts.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I\u2019ll call you back,&#8221; I tell my sister. &#8220;Your brother-in-law is getting ready for office.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Oh, essential service. No stay-at-home. Lucky man,&#8221; she laughs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I hang up and help find his mask.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Socks in the blue box. Masks in the black. How difficult is that to remember? I grumble to myself.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Take the blue striped. It will go with your shirt,&#8221; I tell him when he picks a black one. &#8220;And here is your lunch and sanitiser bottle.&#8221; I hand him both in a freshly washed cloth bag.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Enjoy your WFH,&#8221; he says stepping out.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;With ever-hungry kids, a slow Internet and a never-ending job list, that is a tall order,&#8221; I say. I close the door behind him and start my daily disinfecting routine. Light switches, door handles, key boards&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Aren\u2019t you being a bit paranoid,&#8221; asks my son watching me clean the buttons on the remote with a baby cotton bud.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I wouldn\u2019t have been, if you guys were more responsible. Look at this,&#8221; I show him the greasy fingerprints on the remote.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Amma, I have my Zoom classes now. Can you guys keep your voices down?&#8221; the younger one bursts into the room munching on something. &#8220;And please don\u2019t barge into my room without knocking.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;By the way, did you wash your hands properly before snacking on that thing,&#8221; I ask her.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Yep. You don&#8217;t have to ask me that all the time. I am not in kindergarten, you know,&#8221; she says.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;She did, Amma. I heard her singing happy birthday twice. It was hilarious.&#8221; My son guffaws and she stomps off to her room.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Sabjiwala is here.&#8221; I get a notification from my housing society\u2019s WhatsApp group. I look at the clock. I have been assigned the 9 to 9.30 slot. Ten people at a time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I mask up and walk down three flights of stairs to join the queue. At the landing, a man in a tracksuit runs past me, keeping no distancing whatsoever. What a nerve! I flap my hands in the air, almost involuntarily, as if to chase off any germs that might have rolled off him.<br>In the apartment compound, the queue looks longer than I expected. There are more than the permitted 10 people. Someone waves at me. Is it my next-door neighbour or the one from the other block? With the distance and the mask, it&#8217;s difficult to tell.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>By the time I reach the front of the queue, there is hardly any good stuff left. Dejected, I climb the three flights back home to find the children watching TV, the volume set high. &#8220;The teacher\u2019s Wi-Fi isn&#8217;t working. So class cancelled,&#8221; my daughter tells me happily.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;You can finish your class projects then,&#8221; I tell her, removing my mask and breathing freely. &#8220;No. We are watching Contagion. It\u2019s about this deadly virus,&#8221; she says enthusiastically.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Why do you want to watch it now? It&#8217;s scary, as it is,&#8221; I tell her. &#8220;We are mentally preparing for the worst,&#8221; the elder one laughs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;It\u2019s no laughing matter. People are dying, you know.&#8221; I express my disagreement on the matter.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Come on, Amma. Take it easy. The virus is going to be here for a long time. We will lose our sanity if we are serious and scared all the time. Let us stay positive and learn to live with it,&#8221; he says sagely.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am impressed. &#8220;You\u2019re right. There is no point in worrying. Let us stay positive. Maybe we should do something productive. Together. Like cooking. What do you say?&#8221; I am super thrilled.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Hmm&#8230; I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; he shrugs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Come on. Cooking is a life skill. It will be useful for you in the future as well, like when you stay in a hostel. Let us do it. Today.&#8221; I get carried away and jot down in my mind a list of things to make.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Maybe tomorrow, Amma. I have to finish my project first,&#8221; the younger one says, scooting off to her room. &#8220;I too have an assignment to do,&#8221; says the elder and disappears.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Let us do it tomorrow then,&#8221; I shout after them. I wait for an answer, but all I could hear is the sound of doors being shut.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As I log on to my office\u2019s website and get ready for WFH, I feel strangely relieved that at least some things are still the old normal.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\"><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>&#8220;Which zone are you in,&#8221; asks my sister over the phone.
