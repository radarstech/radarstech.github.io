Say hello to Seetha, our Associate Creative Director.<\/h5>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"\/>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1) When did you start writing?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have been writing ever since I can remember, but started taking it seriously only during college.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2) Who are some favourite writers who have inspired you?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s hard to name just a few. I always find new ones. Right now it\u2019s Clare Allan and her book, Poppy Shakespeare.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3) What is your process of writing?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At times it\u2019s a very simple process. The thoughts and words flow freely and everything falls into place quickly. Sometimes it involves tons of drafts, rewrites and edits. I like collecting good notebooks and good stationery. It gives that extra motivation to write.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>4) Your articles have been published in leading newspapers. What was it like when you work got published the first time?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It made me want to write more<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>5) You have been so productive and many of your works have won awards. How does that make you feel?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Recognition always makes you feel good. It\u2019s one of those factors that keeps you going, especially when you hit a rough patch.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>6) Do you believe in creative blocks? Have you experienced it? If yes, how did you overcome it?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes. I try to take my mind off writing and listen to some good music. It usually helps me see things in a new perspective. But being in a profession where deadlines matter, sometimes you\u2019ll have to work through a block. Half the battle is showing up.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>7) On writing, Bukowski says, \u201cIf it doesn\u2019t come bursting out of you in spite of everything, don\u2019t do it. Unless it comes unasked out of your heart and your mind and your mouth and your gut, don\u2019t do it.\u201d Do you agree with this or do you think writing comes with hardwork and discipline?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even if writing \u2018comes out of your soul like a rocket\u2019, I believe without hard work and discipline you won\u2019t be able to sustain it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>8) What is one style of writing you have never tried or wish to try in the future?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I would like to try my hand at poetry, because I usually write prose.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>9) Writing for leisure. Writing as a vocation. What do you prefer and why?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Both. Writing gives me great joy and a sense of fulfilment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>10) What is your advice to young writers?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Read. Read. Read.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>There are stories on her fingertips. She traverses worlds with her imagination and carries the reader into realms of fantasy.
