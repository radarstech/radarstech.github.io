With no office or equipment, they started around a dining table, and in a short while, began to be known for their hands-on approach, trustworthiness and refreshingly effective ideas. In fact, this team would set the tone for Stark\u2019s work over the years.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Inherently Indie<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The way in which Stark has worked over the last two decades is what could perhaps be described as an &#8216;indie&#8217; approach. At the heart of it, this is about being proudly local and working with a close community of passionate people independent of larger allegiances\u2013 people who desire to create meaningful work that expands boundaries\u2013while being truthful to themselves and their clients.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Seeing the&nbsp;Big&nbsp;Picture<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Stark firmly believes that brands need a cohesive and comprehensive communication strategy in these times of extensive fragmentation. Thus emerged its spectrum of services ranging from Strategic Planning, Business Consulting, Advertising, Design and&nbsp;Digital to Branded Content. Its impressive client retention record &#8211; including some relationships that span over two decades &#8211; is proof for the success of this approach.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Letting the&nbsp;Work&nbsp;Speak<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Characteristically, Stark has always stayed under the radar while creating highly visible campaigns for its brands. In over 27 years, the agency has evolved a trademark local-global synergy that helps it to create strikingly authentic brand ideas. Some of India\u2019s most renowned brands and memorable campaigns testify to this.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>A&nbsp;Widening Arc<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, Stark is present in Trivandrum, Kochi, Bengaluru, Hyderabad and New Delhi in India and consistently wins awards for its work involving a host of brands across travel, media, healthcare, technology, IT,&nbsp;retail, FMCG, aviation,&nbsp;real&nbsp;estate,&nbsp;banking,&nbsp;sports,&nbsp;education and&nbsp;infrastructure \u2013 both in the public and private sector.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The&nbsp;Start Led by TK Harshan, Swarup BR and Roy V Mathew, a little team set out on an exciting journey from the city of Trivandrum in 1994.
